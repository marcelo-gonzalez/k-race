There's a race in vchiq_dump_platform_instances in the file
drivers/staging/vc04_services/interface/vchiq_arm/vchiq_arm.c
where the ->mark field in struct vchiq_service is used to keep
track of what has been printed so far, but there's no locking.
So this reproducer shows that you can get readers of /dev/vchiq
to see fewer results than they should
